# Gram-Schmidt-orthogonalization-

The program stores sets of vectors in the matrix.  Each row is a different vector. The elements in the matrix are randomly generated from 0 to 1. The size of the matrix is n x n. 
N is the dimensionality of space and it is given by the user. The program:

-shows the generated set of vectors,

-checks if it's an orthonormal set,

-performs Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization,

-shows the set of vectors after Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization,

-normalizes the matrix,

-checks if a set of vectors after Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization is an orthonormal set.

## Instructions: 
First to use the program, one must install the Python compiler. To do so, enter the site and follow the given steps: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/.

Then to start the program you must give the dimensionality of the space.
